# football-telegram-bot

Bot for collecting and analyzing scores. The project was created for educational purposes. And for fun sure)


This telegram bot can count scores in table soccer games. And collect analitycs about games.
I half-assed this project in one evening  just for play with [Peewee ORM](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/)
 and Telegram API library [python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)


**P.S.** I haven't run this project a long time, and probably this project maight not start at all. I think, I will archive this project and won't touch it because I don't want to :)
